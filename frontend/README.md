# React

This frontend project is established by Vite (a frontend build tool) that can help solve the dependencies of es modules.

`npm run dev` will start the a local development server that serves html, js, and css files for the frontend.
`npm run build` will build and bundle the whole fronted project into a dist folder, which we can then deploy to a real server.
